        <h2>Golden Ratio in Music</h2>
        <p>The mythical and mystical side of the golden ratio is not the prerogative of figurative art, many musicians have been won by the magic of these mathematical relationships and numerous great composers of the past have used it in their works. We can find it in the rhythms and musical structures, in the arrangement of accents within movements and in the relationship between the latter. Many examples show how the proportion of the various parts of a work is often set in the 8/5 ratio, close to the Phi number.
             It is easy to find those elements in some works by Bach, Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven. But in addition to the formal canons of musical language, it is in the very atoms of music, the notes, that the golden ratio can be found incredibly. In the octave, the founding unit of melody and harmony, we see Fibonacci numbers popping up everywhere.

            In the music of the twentieth century the golden ratio has found fertile ground spreading out of all proportion: Debussy, Stockhausen, Bartók, Stravinsky, Manzoni, Ligeti, are just some of the best known names that have voluntarily chosen the use of these magical proportions. Towards the end of the 1900s, a real university research group was born in Paris, the Center d’Études de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales, with the aim of applying scientific and mathematical knowledge to music.
            
            Today Rock music, especially progressive one, has let itself be conquered by golden proportions. A very significant example is Genesis’ brave song Firth of Fifth, which contains solos of 55, 34, 13 bars entirely based on golden numbers. Not even the most rock band ever, Deep Purple, has remained insensitive to the call of the “golden numbers”, as the famous song Child in Time shows. Dream Theater’s Octavarium album and Tool’s Lateralus piece are also designed on Fibonacci sequences.</p>

                    <h2>Musical scales</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Fibonacci series appears in the foundation of aspects of art, beauty and life. Even music has a foundation in the series, as:
                        <br>

                        There are 13 notes in the span of any note through its octave, 
                        a scale is composed of 8 notes, of which the 5th and 3rd notes create the basic foundation of all chords, and
                        are based on a tone which are combination of 2 steps and 1 step from the root tone, that is the 1st note of the scale.
                        <br>
                        The word “octave” comes from the Latin word for 8, referring to the eight tones of the complete musical scale, which in the key of C are C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C.
                        In a scale, the dominant note is the 5th note of the major scale, which is also the 8th note of all 13 notes that comprise the octave.  This provides an added instance of Fibonacci numbers in key musical relationships.  Interestingly, 8/13 is .61538, which approximates phi.  What’s more, the typical three chord song in the key of A is made up of A, its Fibonacci & phi partner E, and D, to which A bears the same relationship as E does to A. This is analogous to the “A is to B as B is to C” basis for the golden section, or in this case “D is to A as A is to E.”

                    <h2>Musical frequencies </h2>
                    <p>Notes in the scale of western music are based on natural harmonics that are created by ratios of frequencies.  Ratios found in the first seven numbers of the Fibonacci series ( 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ) are related to key frequencies of musical notes.</p>

                    <p>The calculated frequency above starts with A440 and applies the Fibonacci relationships.  In practice, pianos are tuned to a “tempered” frequency, a man-made adaptation devised to provide improved tonality when playing in various keys.  Pluck a string on a guitar, however, and search for the harmonics by lightly touching the string without making it touch the frets and you will find pure Fibonacci relationships.

                        * A440 is an arbitrary standard.  The American Federation of Musicians accepted the A440 as standard pitch in 1917.  It was then accepted by the U.S. government its standard in 1920 and it was not until 1939 that this pitch was accepted internationally.  Before recent times a variety of tunings were used.  It has been suggested by James Furia and others that A432 be the standard.  A432 was often used by classical composers and results in a tuning of the whole number frequencies that are connected to numbers used in the construction of a variety of ancient works and sacred sites, such as the Great Pyramid of Egypt.  The controversy over tuning still rages, with proponents of A432 or C256 as being more natural tunings than the current standard.</p>

                    <h2>Musical compositions often reflect Fibonacci numbers and phi</h2>
                    <p>Relationships between Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Mean are frequently found when analyzing the structure of compositions and musical patterns dating back several centuries. For example, the climax of many songs or even an important measure where the song changes significantly such as the bridge often occurs near the songs Phi point. As we mentioned earlier, Phi is the basis for the Golden Ratio, Section or Mean. Considerable evidence suggests famous composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Bella Bartok, and many others have used Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Mean to compose measures of music and structure their compositions.
                        <br>

                        The Phi point can be determined by taking the number of measures of a song and multiplying them by 0.618. More often than not the result will mark the beginning of a measure where a significant change occurs. I tested this theory on Disclosure’s hit song “Latch.” Using Ableton Live, I determined the song is roughly 129 measures long. I then multiplied 129 by 0.618 and got approximately 80. Sure enough, measure 80 marked the beginning of a tension building bridge that occurs before the final drop. Hear for yourself; measure 80 starts around 2:37.</p>
                        <p>Composer and teacher Gary Ewer developed a formula that works well to determine where the bridge or highest point in a musical piece often occurs in most modern and historical compositions. This clever musical equation takes the full length of a song and converts it in seconds, which is then multiplied by Phi and converted back to minutes to reveal an approximate time where a significant change may occur in that song. For example, Disclosure song “Latch” is about 4:13 long. To find Phi, we would first convert the minutes into seconds and then add the remaining seconds to get a total amount of seconds for the song. Next, multiply the total amount of seconds by Phi, which is approximately 0.618. Lastly, divide the results by 60 to convert back to minutes, and then multiply the decimals by 60 to find the seconds. Combine the results to determine the time where the climax or bridge of the song may occur. For this example, the formula would like this:
                          <br>
                            4 x 60 + 13 = 253 (total seconds)
                            <br>
                            253 x 0.618 = 156.35
                            <br>
                            156.35 / 60 = 2.60 (2 minutes)
                            <br>
                            0.60 x 60 = 36 (36 seconds)
                            <br>
                            Resulting time: 2:36
                            <br>
                            
                            At 2:36 the same tension building bridge begins that we explored earlier. Very interesting! The following video demonstrates this theory further.</p>

                    <h2>Musical instrument design is often based on phi, the golden ratio</h2>
                    <p>Violins crafted by the master luthier Antonio Stradivari are famously known for their exquisite tonal quality and aesthetic form. Genuine Stradivarius violins are highly sought after and are the most valuable instruments in the string-playing world because of their unmatched sound. However, what is most amazing about his violins was that they were designed and build around the Golden Ratio. The proportions of the violin conform to the ratios of Phi. Even the spiral of a violin scroll reveals how precisely his instruments reflect the Golden Ratio.</p>
