        <h2>Golden Ratio in Architecture</h2>
        <p>It's believed that the Golden Ratio has been in use for at least 4,000 years in human art, design and architecture. However, it may be even longer than that – some people argue that the Ancient Egyptians used the principle to build the pyramids.
            Ancient Greek architecture used the Golden Ratio to determine pleasing dimensional relationships between the width of a building and its height, the size of the portico and even the position of the columns supporting the structure.

           The final result is a building that feels entirely in proportion. The neo-classical architecture movement reused these principles too.
           Leonardo da Vinci, like many other artists throughout the ages, made extensive use of the Golden Ratio to create pleasing compositions. In The Last Supper, the figures are arranged in the lower two thirds (the larger of the two parts of the Golden Ratio), and the position of Jesus is perfectly plotted by arranging golden rectangles across the canvas.

                <p>The Greek sculptor Phidias sculpted many things including the bands of sculpture that run above the columns of the Parthenon.Even from the time of the Greeks, a rectangle whose sides are in the "golden proportion" has been known since it occurs naturally in some of the proportions of the Five Platonic. This rectangle is supposed to appear in many of the proportions of that famous ancient Greek temple in the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.

                <p>The Medieval builders of churches and cathedrals approached the design of their buildings in much the same way as the Greeks. They tried to connect geometry and art.
                    Inside and out, their building were intricate construction based on the golden section.

                    sur une mesure harmonique a l'echelle humaine applicable universalement a l'architecture et a la mecanique ". He invented the word "modulator" by combining "modul" (ratio) and "or" (gold); another expression for the well-known golden ratio</p>

                <h2>Penrose Tilings</h2>
                <p>The British physicist and mathematician, Roger Penrose, has developed an aperiodic tiling which incorporates the golden section. The tiling is comprised of two rhombi, one with angles of 36 and 144 degrees (figure A, which is two Golden Triangles, base to base) and one with angles of 72 and 108 degrees (figure B).
                    When a plane is tiled according to Penrose's directions, the ratio of tile A to tile B is the Golden Ratio.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to the unusual symmetry, Penrose tilings reveal a pattern of overlapping decagons. Each tile within the pattern is contained within one of two types of decagons, and the ratio of the decagon populations is, of course, the ratio of the Golden Mean.

                <h2>Notre Dame</h2>
                <p>  Phi and the use of the golden ratio are found in the design of Notre Dame in Paris, France.  The Gothic Cathedral was built beginning in the year 1163, and completed in the year 1345.  Claimed as the first Christian church in Paris, Notre Name was built upon the Roman temple of Jupiter.  The west façade of the church was completed around the year 1200, and it is here where the presence of the use of the golden ratios is visible.  See the image below with the highlighted segments emphasizing the ratio.</p>

                <h2>UN Building</h2>
                <p>The current headquarters for the United Nations was constructed on an 18-acre piece of land in the East side of Manhattan. Following World War II, the United Nations was established to help intervene in future global conflicts, such as aggression, that would in hope avoid another world war. The organization was established and the headquarters were built under the supervision of lead architect, Wallace K. Harrison from the United States. Although Harrison is not typically known to use the golden ratio in his designs, a French architect Charles E. Jeanneret was on a team of assisting architects. Charles E. Jeanneret was known to frequently use the golden ratio in his architectural designs. When constructing the United Nations headquarters, the team of architects decided to use this ratio in a couple of different ways. When looking closely at the building we observe that many of the windows in fact have the golden ratio when comparing their width and height. The more obvious application of the United Nations headquarters to the golden ratio is found when looking at the width of the entire building and comparing it to the height of every ten floors.</p>
