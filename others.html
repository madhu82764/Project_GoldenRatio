        <h2>Application of Golden in Various other fields</h2>
        <p>Golden Ratio is truly amazing as it is applied in almost every aspect of life. It is everywhere in nature, in us, outside us, in waves , in animals, in plants, in space, in music, in dance, in art, in photography, etc.
            It is amazing to see life and mathematics so interwined.

                <p>According to Jan Tschichold,

                    There was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.
                    
                    According to some sources, the golden ratio is used in everyday design, for example in the proportions of playing cards, postcards, posters, light switch plates, and widescreen televisions.</p>

                    New findings reveal that the universe itself is in the shape of a dodecahedron, a twelve-sided geometric solid with pentagon faces, all based on phi.</p>

                <p>ELFRAD (Extremely Low Frequency Research And Development), a self-funded research organization which tracks radiation on Earth through an array of antennas, has found an extremely low frequency signal at phi, or 1.618033 Hertz, or cycles per second.
                    These  signal bursts with a frequency of 1.618033 hertz appear with no clear relationship with any known source. They are not related to solar anomalies or any known weather pattern. They do vary in amplitude or intensity and are irregular with their timing. We will continue to monitor this frequency and will display the result. These signals have been detected on a global scale and are of extreme interest.

                <h2>Time in Quantum Physics</h2>
                <p>Time in Quantum Physics may be related to Phi. The Golden Ratio seems to be appearing in several places in the Quantum Physics Model.  Because an electron has an electric charge and an intrinsic rotational motion, or spin, it behaves in some respects like a small bar magnet and is said to have a magnetic moment.  Because the electron also has mass, it behaves in some respects like a spinning top, and is said to have spin angular momentum.

                    The g factor of the electron is defined as the ratio of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum.  The electron g-factor is due to the stretching of space-time as the electron spins at the speed of light.
                    
                    Mathematically, the electron g-factor is approximately:
                    <br>
                    
                    gfactore = -2 / sin (Ø)
                    <br>
                    and the proton g-factor is approximately:
                    <br>
                     gfactorp = 2Ø / sin (1/Ø)
                     <br>
                     Thus it appears that the Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time.

   <h2> Photography</h2>

      <div class="col-12">
      <p>The rule of thirds is commonly taught to beginning photographers as a way to set up the composition of their photos.

        It is based on the idea that your photo can be separated into a grid of 9 equal spaces, and the focal points of the image should line up with one or more spots where the lines intersect.
        
        The phi grid is used in photography as another way to break up the image, following the 1:1.618 ratio. The lines are laid out in a grid, but they are not spaced evenly as in the rule of thirds grid.
        
        Both of the grids are used to help the viewer’s eye move around the photograph, and to create a more interesting composition instead of just plopping your subject dead center.
        
        It causes a sort of off-center balance that is more interesting for us to look at.
